# Introduction

Nebula is a JavaScript module tailored to seamlessly integrate a comprehensive suite of [Google Marketing Platform (GMP)](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/) services into your Next.js and React applications. It empowers you to optimize the potential of GMP products, including [Google Tag Manager (GTM)](https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/en_uk/about/tag-manager/), [Google Analytics 4 (GA4)](https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/en_uk/about/analytics/), [Google Campaign Manager (CM360)](https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/en_uk/about/campaign-manager-360/), [Display & Video 360 (DV360)](https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/en_uk/about/display-video-360/) and [Google Ads (GADS)](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_uk/home/), enhancing your ability to track, manage, and analyze your marketing efforts within your web applications.

Nebula goes beyond this, offering a speedy and intuitive tag injection system within your applications. This feature simplifies the process of injecting tags for various marketing and tracking purposes, ensuring that you can efficiently incorporate and manage these tags without the hassle of complex implementations.

As an all-encompassing solution for GMP integration, Nebula eliminates the need for the deprecated Goofls package, which was specifically designed for tag injection related to Campaign Manager (CM360). Nebula seamlessly replaces Goofls, consolidating the management of all GMP services into a single, cohesive module, streamlining your application's integration with GMP products while offering a simpler and more unified approach.

With Nebula, you can harness the power of Google Marketing Platform services and effortlessly embed them into your Next.js and React applications, resulting in a more efficient and data-driven approach to your marketing and analytics needs.
