# Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of web development, managing tracking and analytics in React applications is a crucial component of success. Enter Goofls, a package designed to streamline the management of CM360 (Campaign Manager 360) floodlight tags within React projects. Goofls empowers developers with a simple and efficient solution to implement, track, and manage floodlight tags, ensuring accurate data collection and analysis.

## Legacy and evolution

Originally introduced as a cutting-edge solution, Goofls has now transitioned into a legacy package. While it still offers valuable functionality for managing CM360 floodlight tags, developers are encouraged to consider more modern alternatives, such as "Nebula," for advanced features and enhanced performance. However, for those maintaining existing applications that rely on Goofls, it remains a reliable tool for CM360 floodlight tag management.
