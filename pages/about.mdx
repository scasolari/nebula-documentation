# About

Founded by [Sergio Casolari](https://sergiocasolari.com), we embarked on a mission to address the challenge of integrating CM360 floodlight tags into React applications. Our journey began with a deep-seated commitment to clean, optimized, and fast-loading code.

As the digital landscape continued to evolve, the need for an efficient solution became evident. Goofls was born as the answer to this need, providing developers with a tool to manage floodlight tags without compromising code quality or performance. It quickly gained a loyal user base who appreciated its simplicity and effectiveness.

Today, Goofls has evolved into Nebula, representing a significant leap forward in CM360 floodlight tag management for React applications. While retaining its core principles of clean and efficient code, Nebula offers enhanced features, improved performance, and a simplified installation process to cater to the ever-changing demands of web development.

Our founder, Sergio Casolari, has always been passionate about empowering developers with tools that simplify their work. His vision for clean, optimized code remains at the heart of Nebula's operations today.

We're proud to carry forward Sergio's legacy and continue serving the web development community with Nebula. Thank you for being a part of our journey, and we look forward to providing you with the best tools to manage CM360 floodlight tags in your React applications.
